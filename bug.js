This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a function that returns a cleanup function. If the cleanup function throws an error, it can cause the component to crash or behave unexpectedly. This is because the error is not properly handled by the React Native runtime.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAsyncOperation().subscribe(data => {
    // ...
  });

  return () => {
    //Error thrown here
    subscription.unsubscribe(); //this might throw an error
  };
}, []);
```
